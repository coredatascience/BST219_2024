## Data import

### Importing Spreadsheets

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

In the R module some of the basics of data import are covered. We described functions available in the default R installation. Here we present a more general discussion and introduce the `tidyverse` packages `readr` and `readxl`.

Currently, one of the most commons ways of storing and sharing data for analysis is through electronic spreadsheets. A spreadsheet stores data in rows and columns. It is basically a file version of a data frame. When saving such a table to a computer file one needs a way to define when a new row or column ends and the other begins. This in turn defines the cells in which single values are stored. 

When creating spreadsheets with text files, like the ones you can create with a simple text editor, a new row is defined with return and columns with some predefined special character. The most common characters are comma (`,`), semicolon (`;`), white space (\  ) and tab (\ \ \ \ ). 

You will also note that sometimes the first row contains column names rather than data. We call this a _header_ and when reading data from a spreadsheet it is important to know if the file has a header or not. Most reading functions assume there is a header. To know if the file has a header, it helps to look at the file before trying to read it. This can be done with a text editor or with RStudio. In RStudio we can do this by navigating to the file location, double clicking on the file and hitting _View File_.

However, not all spreadsheet files are text files. Google Sheets, which are rendered on a browser, are an example. Another example is the proprietary format used by Microsoft Excel. These can't be viewed with a text editor. Given the widespread use of Microsoft Excel software, this format is widely used. Although there are R packages designed to read this format, if you are choosing a file format to save your own data, you generally want to avoid Microsoft Excel. We recommend Google Sheets as a free software tool for organizing data.  

### Paths and the Working Directory

We start by demonstrating how to read in a file that is already saved on your computer. There are several ways to do this and we will discuss three of them. But you only need to learn one to follow along.

The first step is to find the file containing your data and know its location on your file system.

When you are working in R it is important to know your _working directory_. This is the directory in which R will save or look for files by default. You can see your working directory by typing:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
getwd()
```

You can change your working directory using the function `setwd`. If you are using RStudio, you can change it by clicking on _Session_.

One thing that file-reading functions have in common is that, **unless a full path is provided, they search for files in the working directory**. For this reason, our recommended approach for beginners is that you create a directory for each analysis and keep the raw data files in that directory. To keep raw data files organized, we recommend creating a `data` directory, especially when the project involves more than one data file.

Because you may not have a data file handy yet, we provide example data files in the `dslabs` package. Once you download and install the `dslabs` package, files will be in the external data (`extdata`) directory:

```{r}
system.file("extdata", package = "dslabs")
```

Note that the output of this function call will change depending on your operating system, how you installed R and the version of R. But it will be consistent within your system and you will be able to see the files included in this directory using the function `list.files`:

```{r}
path <- system.file("extdata", package = "dslabs")
list.files(path)
```

Now that we know the location of these files, we are ready to import them into R. To make the code simpler and following along easier, you can move this file to your working directory. You can do this through the file system directly, but you can also do it within R itself using the `file.copy` function. To do this it will help to define a variable with the full path using the function `file.path`. Using `paste` is not recommended since Microsoft Windows and Macs/Linux/Unix use different slashes for the paths. The function `file.path` is aware of your system and chooses the correct slashes. Here is an example:

```{r}
filename <- "murders.csv"
fullpath <- file.path(path, filename)
fullpath
```

You can now copy the file over to the working directory like this:

```{r}
file.copy(fullpath, getwd())
```

You can check if the file is now in your working directory using the `file.exists` function:

```{r}
file.exists(filename)
```

### The `readr` and `readxl` packages

Now we are ready to read in the file. `readr` is the `tidyverse` library that includes functions for reading data stored in text file spreadsheets into R. The following functions are available to read-in spreadsheets:

| Function | Format | Typical suffix |
|----------|--------|---| 
| read_table | white space separated values | txt |
| read_csv | comma separated values|  csv |
| read_csv2 | semicolon separated values | csv |
| read_tsv | tab delimited separated values | tsv |
| read_delim | general text file format, must define delimiter | txt |

The `readxl` package provides functions to read in Microsoft Excel formats:

| Function | Format | Typical suffix |
|----------|--------|---| 
| read_excel | auto detect the format | xls, xlsx|
| read_xls | original format |  xls |
| read_xlsx | new format | xlsx |


Note that the Microsoft Excel formats permit you to have more than one spreadsheet in one file. These are referred to as _sheets_. The functions above read the first sheet by default but the `excel_sheets` function gives us the names of the sheets in an excel file. These names can then be passed to the `sheet` argument in the three functions above to read sheets other than the first.

Note that the suffix usually tells us what type of file it is, but there is no guarantee that these always match. We can open the file to take a look or use the function `read_lines` to look at a few lines:

```{r}
read_lines("murders.csv", n_max = 3)
```

This also shows that there is a header. Now we are ready to read the data into R. From the suffix and the peek at the file we know to use `read_csv`:

```{r}
dat <- read_csv(filename)
```

We can also use the full path for the file:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
dat <- read_csv(fullpath)
```

Note that we receive a message letting us know what data types were used for each column. Also note that `dat` is a `tibble` with the content in the file:

```{r}
head(dat)
```

### R-base functions

We have briefly talked about this in our R-basics module.
R-base also provides import functions. These have similar names to those in the `tidyverse`: `read.table`, `read.csv` and `read.delim` for example. 

```{r}
dat2 <- read.csv(filename)
```

One difference is that now we have a data frame and not a tibble:

```{r}
class(dat2)
```


### Downloading files

Another common place for data to reside is on the internet. When these are data files we can download them and then import them or even read them directly from the web. For example, we note that because our `dslabs` package is on GitHub, the file we downloaded with the package has a url.

```{r}
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rafalab/dslabs/master/inst/extdata/murders.csv"
```

The `read_csv` file can read these files directly:

```{r}
dat <- read_csv(url)
```

If you want to have a local copy of the file, you can use `download.file`. 

```{r, eval=TRUE}
download.file(url, "murders.csv")
```

Two functions that are sometimes useful when downloading data from the internet is `tempdir` and `tempfile`. The first actually creates a directory with a name that is very likely to be unique. Similarly, `tempfile` creates a character string, not a file, that is likely to be a unique filename:

```{r}
tempfile()
```

So you can run commands like this which erases the temporary file once it imports the data:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
tmp_filename <- tempfile()
download.file(url, tmp_filename)
dat <- read_csv(tmp_filename)
file.remove(tmp_filename)
head(dat)
```


### Nuances

When reading in spreadsheets many things can go wrong. The file might have a multiline header, be missing cells, or it might use an unexpected [encoding]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encoding). We recommend you read this [post](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/). 

With experience you will learn how to deal with different challenges. Carefully reading the help files for the functions discussed here will help. Two other functions that are helpful are `scan` and `readLines`. With scan you can read in each cell of a file. Here is an example:

```{r}
x <- scan(filename, sep=",", what = "c")
x[1:10]
```


### Removing a file

Now that we are done with the example we will remove the example spreadsheet we copied over to our working directory using the function `file.remove`.

```{r}
file.remove(filename)
```
